                My name is Colleen Scannell and I am a senior Finance and MIS major at the University of Oklahoma.
                I was born and raised in California, until my family moved to Frisco, Texas this past summer.
                At OU, I am a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority and served as the Director of Finance in 2019. Outside of OU,
                I have worked as a Receptionist at a Tanning Salon for 4 years now, been a Victoria Secret Pink Campus Representative for 2 years,
                and work remote as a Finance intern for Marquis Software. I plan to graduate in May of 2022 and study abroad in Spain, taking my final course: Capstone.
                After that, I hope to find a job in the DFW Area.

                    Ou has provided me with many different opportunities for projects.
                    In my financial modeling class, my team and I created a Retirement Plan dashboard and a complete Pro Forma model for our chosen company, Costoco.
                    If you wish to see the final spreadsheet of the Pro Forma model, please click <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1butNA62ytQQVZNScQuDxd10zy34hWIc4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101458214941037228492&rtpof=true&sd=true">here</a>
                    In addition, in  my Business Communication class, we created a company and a product and pitched it to a group of "investors." We gave many speeches, performed SWOT analysis,
                    and devised marketing plans.
                    The project I enjoyed the most is my Database Project. A group of 4 and I developed a database to track information for a fly-fishing company.
                    We met with the "CEO," our teacher, created an ERD diagram, converted it into Normal Forms, implemented them into Microsoft SQL Server, and then ran
                    many SQL Statements. We also constructed a 20 page write up detailing our findings. If you would like to view my Database Project, please click <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tNn9pXcM9EluJGDHg-qSQYNxOp01QoHd/view?usp=sharing">here</a>
